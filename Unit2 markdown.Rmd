## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


###this is the rmarkdown file for "for live session 2" assignment

#load libraries to be used

```

#First part visually represent the number of players in each position

#easiest way to see number of players by position is a bar chart since these are classes

#second part, visually investigate that the distribution of the weights of centers is greater than the weights of forwards

#start by setting up plot window to 2 columns using par(mfrow())

#third part visually investigate if height of C is higher than height of F

#fourth part, use dataset to visually investigate if the distribution of height is different between any of the positions
```{r}
